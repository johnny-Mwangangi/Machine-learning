# Machine-learning
This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms on structured datasets. The goal is to understand how different learning paradigms work, evaluate their performance, and analyze their strengths and limitations.

Overview
Machine learning allows systems to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.

This project focuses on two major categories:
1. Supervised Learning > learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning > discovering patterns in unlabeled data

Both approaches are implemented and evaluated to understand their practical applications.

Learning Approaches
A) Supervised Learning
Supervised learning models are trained using labeled datasets, where the correct output is known.

Tasks covered:
1. Classification
2. Regression

Examples:
- Predicting class labels
- Predicting numerical values

B) Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning models work with unlabeled data and aim to find hidden structures or patterns.

Tasks covered:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction

Examples:
- Grouping similar data points
- Feature extraction

Dataset
Type: Structured (tabular) data
- Source: Public datasets (e.g., World Bank Data, Kaggle)
- Size: Varies by experiment

Preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling (Standardization / Normalization)
- Train-test split (for supervised learning)
